# Data Collection Utility

A Local measurement input assistant.

Motivation: 

- Consistency, right at the source 
- Assist with metadata acquisition on a measurement PC as much as possible where the original instrument software does not foresee or support automation, i.e. requires user interaction 
- Save time required for filling out DataStore forms repeatedly
